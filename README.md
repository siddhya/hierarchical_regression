# hierarchical_regression
Python code for hierarchical multiple linear regressions. This code has been checked and validated against the same analysis conducted in SPSS. The code can be used as is currently (i.e. the items on the to-do list are future projects to further improve performance).

Done: 
1) DONE ~~Adapt linear_reg to return coefficient values and coefficient p-values along with the predictor variable name~~
2) DONE ~~Add function (regression_diagnostics.py) to check assumptions of multiple linear regression~~
3) DONE ~~Integrate assumption checks code into hierarchical_regression.py~~
4) DONE ~~Compare results from hierarchical_regression.py to results from conducting same hierarchical regression in SPSS~~

To-do:
1) Write unit tests
2) Profile code + improve speed & memory usage
3) Suppress matplotlib text in regression_diagnostics.py
4) Improve info in regression_diagnostics.py summary text files
